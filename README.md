Image Generation with Variational Auto Encoder

This project is about a network that can lean the pattern of the input image data and generate new images that follow the same pattern. The model is based on this paper [1], where the authors illustrated the idea of Variational Autoencoders. The value of Image data is represented as a multi-dimensional probability distribution. Each pixel value on the image is a point sampled from a probability distribution. For instance, a greyscale image of 28*28 resolution is a 784-dimension probability distribution. Variational Autoencoders maps the imageâ€™s high dimensional space into a lower dimension space, and can also recover the image data back to the high dimension from that lower dimension space. The model consists of three parts: the encoder layer, reparametrize layer and the decoder layer.
